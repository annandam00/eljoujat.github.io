I'm programmer, and i've always believed that every good progammer [should have a blog](http://architects.dzone.com/articles/why-programmers-should-have). This week i made the decision to write my first post, before  that i had to answer some questions :

- What shoud i blogg about ? 
- which blogging platform to use ?

and then :

- start blogging

This blog will be my laboratory .
