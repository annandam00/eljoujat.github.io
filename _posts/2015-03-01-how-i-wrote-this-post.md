I'm programmer, and i've always believed that every good progammer [should have a blog](http://architects.dzone.com/articles/why-programmers-should-have). This week i made the decision to write my first post, before  that i had to answer some questions :

- What shoud i blogg about ? 
- which blogging platform to use ?
- start blogging 



##Blogging about ...?


This was for me the most difficult question to answer, as i considered for long time that i had no interesting things to add or share ... 

Guess what ! I was wrong all the time, and what's obvious to me could be amazing for others   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcmI5SSQLmE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


So start blogging about ....

![A terribly boring amateur comic strip](/images/blogger_joke.jpg)

Eevery programming experiment i do , every new software concept i learnt or i wish to learn. Sometimes  on my dail job tasks, i face new problems that take me time to solve, so i will also write post describing how i solve it. I will also write posts about any idea that came to me .

Bref, This blog will be my laboratory.

## Ghost, Medium, Blogger,... which blogging platform to use ?

I start my day with reading what's new on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news), most of them are posts on blog hosted on platforms , like [Medium](https://medium.com/), [svbtle](https://svbtle.com/), [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com), [ghost](https://ghost.org/). each one of theme has pros and cons that i will not details here .

I made a short list of what features i need .

- Free hosting ☺  (a personal domain is not) .
- Progammer freindly :allow to write code with features like , formatting, syntax highliting...
- Simple and minimalist
- Easy and powerful customization 
- Allow to write fast and publishing faster.


[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) as free hosting solution was what suited for me the best .

## Start Blogging
